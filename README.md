# Dkbay's Portfolio
I felt I like I'd reached a point where I should start making a portfolio, and make some sites that show off what I've learned and what I can do. So I decided I'd make this and put it on Github. 

The portfolio site itself uses Vue.js, JS & Bootstrap, I tried to keep everything fairly small not using a lot of images and combining css/js files to keep load times down.
